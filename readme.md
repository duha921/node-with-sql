# NodeJS with SQL DB

----
## What you will see

These are samples of the sql queries with NodeJs serve

----
## What you have to do first
* you will need a running sql server on your localhost

* you can use [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), [Mamp](https://www.mamp.info/en/), [Wamp](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) or whatever you like

* you will need to create a DB if you don't have any and table etc...

----
## Focus on the last example
#### complexWhere
Since the sql query is a string, so we can play with strings ðŸŽ¸as we like,
to create flexible endpoints that user can handle it from his end


----
Please read it fork it and try to create a more complex sample.
